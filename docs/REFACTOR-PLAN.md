# Frontend refactor plan

Eight phases, each a self-contained PR. Order matters — earlier phases land
the scaffolding the later ones depend on. After every phase, the app should
build, type-check, and pass the test suite. No phase rewrites everything; we
take chips off the block.

The end-state targets:

- `Board.tsx` and `Dashboard.tsx` both under **400 lines**.
- Every other file under **300 lines** unless it's a single cohesive feature.
- Zero `localStorage.*` outside `src/lib/storage.ts`.
- Zero `supabase.*` and zero `fetch('/api/*')` outside `src/services/`.
- Zero `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(...))` for cross-component IPC.
- Test coverage thresholds: **lib 80% / services 70% / hooks 60% / components 30% (smoke)**.

---

## Phase 0 — Test scaffolding

Lands first so every later phase has a safety net.

**Add:**
- `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jsdom`, `msw` (devDependencies).
- `web/vite.config.ts` — wire `test` block, jsdom env, setup file.
- `web/src/test/setup.ts` — RTL + jest-dom matchers.
- `web/src/test/mocks/supabase.ts` — minimal stub returning `{ data, error }` shapes.
- `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage` scripts.

**Initial tests** (one smoke test per top-level surface, just to prove the harness works):
- `App.test.tsx` — renders SignIn when unauthenticated.
- `Landing.test.tsx` — shows "Create New Board" / "Join existing".
- `TadaLanding.test.tsx` — renders the hero + tour without crashing.

**Acceptance:**
- `npm test` runs and reports green.
- Coverage report is produced.
- CI fails the PR if any test fails.

---

## Phase 1 — `lib/` extraction

Pure helpers. Mechanical, low risk. Removes duplication so later phases shrink.

**Create:**
```
src/lib/
  storage.ts       # typed key constants + read/write/clear helpers
  hash.ts          # hashCode (currently in Board.tsx, Toolbar.tsx, Dashboard.tsx as hashStr)
  ranks.ts         # RANK_MEDALS + ordinal() (currently 3× duplicated)
  time.ts          # timeAgo (currently in Dashboard.tsx)
  buildMarkdown.ts # lifted from Board.tsx top, made pure
```

`storage.ts` shape:
```ts
export const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  theme: 'beacons-theme',
  cursors: 'beacons-cursors',
  linearApiKey: 'beacons-linear-key',
  teamTabSelected: 'beacons-team-tab-selected',
  guestUser: 'beacons-guest',
} as const;
export const storage = {
  read<T>(key: keyof typeof STORAGE_KEYS): T | null,
  write<T>(key: keyof typeof STORAGE_KEYS, val: T): void,
  clear(key: keyof typeof STORAGE_KEYS): void,
}
```

**Migrate callsites** so every component imports from `lib/storage` instead
of touching `localStorage` directly.

**Tests:**
- `lib/storage.test.ts` — round-trip, missing key, JSON parse failure.
- `lib/hash.test.ts` — known-input determinism.
- `lib/ranks.test.ts` — `ordinal(1) === '1st'`, `ordinal(11) === '11th'`, etc.
- `lib/time.test.ts` — fixed `Date.now()` and assert formatting bands.
- `lib/buildMarkdown.test.ts` — snapshot a small representative board state.

**Acceptance:**
- `grep -r 'localStorage' src/` returns hits only inside `lib/storage.ts`.
- All pre-existing duplicate `RANK_MEDALS`, `hashCode`, `hashStr` declarations deleted.
- Tests above all pass.

---

## Phase 2 — `services/` data layer

Pull every Supabase call and every `/api/*` fetch out of components.

**Create:**
```
src/services/
  boards.ts      # list, get, create, update, archive, restore, delete, attachToTeam
  actions.ts    # forBoard, previousForTeam, updateLinearLink
  teams.ts      # list, create, update, delete, members.ensureMembership
  linear.ts     # wraps linearClient with auth-aware retry + 401 → clearKey
  http.ts       # tiny fetch wrapper that adds X-Forwarded-Proto guard, json parse, error normalisation
```

Each service exports plain async functions returning typed results. They never
read React state, never touch the DOM, never throw raw fetch errors — they
return tagged results or throw `ServiceError` instances callers can switch on.

**Migrate** every `supabase.from(...)` and every `fetch('/api/...')` from
components into the matching service. Components use `boards.list()`,
`teams.create({ name })`, etc.

**Tests:**
- `services/boards.test.ts` — mock Supabase client; assert correct query
  shape (filters, columns) and result mapping.
- `services/actions.test.ts` — `previousForTeam` returns only unfinished
  actions, sorted, capped at 10.
- `services/teams.test.ts` — auto-membership ensure path.
- `services/linear.test.ts` — 401 path clears the key and rethrows
  `LinearAuthError`.

**Acceptance:**
- `grep -r 'supabase\.' src/components/` returns 0 results.
- `grep -r "fetch('/api" src/components/` returns 0 results.
- Service tests cover the happy and error path of each public function.

---

## Phase 3 — Custom hooks (Board.tsx slim-down)

Slice `Board.tsx` into focused hooks. Each hook owns its refs, effects, and
returns a stable handler shape.

**Create:**
```
src/hooks/board/
  usePanZoom.ts          # transform ref, zoomTo, screenToCanvas, wheel handler
  useMarqueeSelection.ts # marqueeRef, selDragRef, selection, drag selection broadcast
  useClipboard.ts        # copyItems, pasteItems, hasClipboard
  useRemoteCursors.ts    # cursors state, send throttle, RAF batching
  useBoardKeyboard.ts    # paste/escape/space subscriptions
  useVoteUI.ts           # myVoteCount, hasRemainingVotes, rankMap, getEffectiveVoteCount, getEffectiveRank
                         # (also imported by VotePanel — kills the duplicated derivation)
```

Each hook has its own test file with mocked refs + simulated events.

**Acceptance:**
- `Board.tsx` < 400 lines.
- `VotePanel.tsx` and `Board.tsx` both consume `useVoteUI` (no duplicated `myVoteCount`/`rankMap`).
- Hook tests cover state transitions and edge cases (zoom clamp, drag threshold, copy with no selection, paste with no clipboard).

---

## Phase 4 — Replace the global event bus

Delete every `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(...))` used as IPC
between sibling components, and the runtime-installed
`window.__triggerReactionRain` / `__handleCursorMove` globals.

**Create:**
```
src/state/
  BoardUiContext.tsx
```

Holds the UI-only state currently bus-coupled:
- `votePanelOpen`, `viewingHistoryId`, `ranksVisible`, `cursorsEnabled`,
  `timerOpen` (already board-state, stays put), reaction trigger.

`useBoardUi()` returns these plus their setters. `useReactionTrigger()` returns
a function callers invoke directly; `ReactionRain` registers via the same
context, no globals.

**Migrate** `Board.tsx`, `VotePanel.tsx`, `Toolbar.tsx`, `FloatingMenu.tsx`,
`ReactionRain.tsx`, `ActionsPanel.tsx` to consume the context.

**Tests:**
- `BoardUiContext.test.tsx` — provider wires setters; multiple consumers see
  updates; reaction trigger invokes registered callback.

**Acceptance:**
- `grep -r 'window.dispatchEvent' src/` returns 0 results.
- `grep -r 'window.__' src/` returns 0 results.
- All five existing custom events (`vote-panel-visibility`, `vote-view-change`,
  `vote-ranks-visibility`, `toggle-vote-panel`, `cursors-toggle`) are gone.

---

## Phase 5 — Split `Dashboard.tsx`

The biggest single file. Three apps in one.

**Create:**
```
src/pages/dashboard/
  Dashboard.tsx                 # ~250 lines: layout, tab routing, modal dispatch
  BoardsTab.tsx
  ActionsTab.tsx
  TeamsTab.tsx
  teams/
    TeamManager.tsx             # lift from Dashboard.tsx:2229
    TeamTabCreateModal.tsx      # lift from Dashboard.tsx:2397
    TeamTabSelector.tsx         # lift from Dashboard.tsx:2516
    TeamMultiSelect.tsx         # lift from Dashboard.tsx:2560
  modals/
    NewBoardModal.tsx
    TemplatePickerModal.tsx
  hooks/
    useTeamPageFilters.ts       # the 8-setter cluster on line 1356 → reducer
```

Each tab calls services from Phase 2; no `supabase.` import anywhere in
the dashboard tree.

**Tests:**
- `BoardsTab.test.tsx` — renders empty state, renders summaries, calls
  `boards.archive` on archive click.
- `TeamsTab.test.tsx` — renders teams from `teams.list`.
- `useTeamPageFilters.test.ts` — reducer transitions.

**Acceptance:**
- `Dashboard.tsx` < 400 lines.
- All four lifted helpers live in their own files.

---

## Phase 6 — Split `FeatureTour.tsx`

10 demos in one file.

**Create:**
```
src/pages/tada/
  TadaLanding.tsx          # already exists, keep
  FeatureTour.tsx          # ~80 lines: layout + features list + dispatch
  features.ts              # the FEATURES array
  demos/
    DemoBoard.tsx
    DemoVote.tsx
    DemoTimer.tsx
    DemoHide.tsx
    DemoLinear.tsx
    DemoOCD.tsx
    DemoActions.tsx
    DemoMarkdown.tsx
    DemoReactionRain.tsx
    DemoNewBoard.tsx
  demoShell.tsx            # shared chrome + sticky styling
```

All demos import `RANK_MEDALS` / `ordinal` from `lib/ranks` (added in Phase 1).

**Tests:**
- One smoke test per demo: `render(<DemoTimer />)` + assert the start button
  exists.

**Acceptance:**
- `FeatureTour.tsx` < 200 lines.
- No demo file > 200 lines.

---

## Phase 7 — Trim Toolbar, ActionsPanel, LinearSync

**Toolbar.tsx** → split into:
- `Toolbar.tsx` (top-level layout)
- `toolbar/SessionMeta.tsx` (name + team + access edit)
- `toolbar/BoardSettings.tsx` (the cog menu)
- `toolbar/UsersIndicator.tsx`

**ActionsPanel.tsx** → split into:
- `ActionsPanel.tsx` (the panel itself)
- `actions/PreviousActions.tsx`
- `actions/CreateLinearIssue.tsx` (lifts the inline modal)
- `services/actions.ts` already owns `previousForTeam`.

**LinearSync.tsx** — keep as one feature but extract:
- `linear/ConnectStep.tsx`
- `linear/ChooseStep.tsx`
- `linear/CycleList.tsx`, `linear/ProjectList.tsx`

**Acceptance:**
- Toolbar.tsx < 200 lines, ActionsPanel.tsx < 250 lines, LinearSync.tsx < 350 lines.

---

## Phase 8 — CSS split

`web/src/styles/index.css` is ~7000 lines. Vite handles `@import` cleanly.

**Create:**
```
src/styles/
  index.css            # only @import lines + variables block
  base.css             # body, html, scrollbars, theme variables
  buttons.css
  landing.css
  signin.css
  tada.css
  dashboard.css
  board.css
  postit.css
  section.css
  vote.css
  timer.css
  actions.css
  cyclestats.css
  giphy.css
  rice.css
  feature-tour/
    index.css
    demos.css
    rain.css
```

No CSS rules change; only physical layout.

**Acceptance:**
- `index.css` is < 200 lines (mostly imports + tokens).
- Visual diff against pre-split deploy: zero pixel changes (eyeballed).

---

## Sequencing rules

- One phase per PR.
- Each PR ships green tests, type-check, build.
- Each PR includes a one-line entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (create on first PR).
- Don't combine phases. The point is bisectability if something regresses.
- If a phase is large, split it into sub-PRs (e.g. Phase 5 could be one PR per tab) but keep the dependency order.

---

## What we're not doing (and why)

- **Not introducing Redux/Zustand.** The board's reducer over the WS stream is
  fine; UI-only state goes into `BoardUiContext`. Adding a third store layer
  for ~10k lines is overkill.
- **Not switching CSS to CSS-in-JS / Tailwind.** Beacons has a working theme
  system; rewriting it to match a different paradigm is a year of paper-cuts
  for no user-visible benefit.
- **Not adding e2e (Playwright) yet.** Vitest + RTL covers the units; e2e is
  Phase 9+ once the unit suite stabilises.
- **Not refactoring the server.** That's a separate audit.
